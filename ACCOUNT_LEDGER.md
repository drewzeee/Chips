# Account Ledger System

The Account Ledger provides a detailed view of individual investment accounts, showing current holdings, cash positions, cost basis, and unrealized gains/losses.

## Overview

Each investment account now has a dedicated ledger view that calculates and displays:

- **Current Holdings**: Stocks and crypto positions with real-time market values
- **Cash Position**: Available cash balance from deposits/withdrawals/dividends
- **Cost Basis Tracking**: Average cost per share and total investment
- **Unrealized P&L**: Gains and losses on current positions
- **Transaction History**: Detailed record of all account activity

## Features

### üìä Holdings Analysis
- **Position Tracking**: Automatically calculates quantities from BUY/SELL transactions
- **Average Cost Basis**: Weighted average cost including fees
- **Real-time Pricing**: Current market values using Yahoo Finance and CoinGecko APIs
- **Unrealized P&L**: Gain/loss calculations with percentage returns

### üí∞ Cash Management
- **Cash Balance**: Tracks deposits, withdrawals, dividends, and fees
- **Transaction Impact**: Shows how trades affect available cash
- **Currency Support**: Multi-currency account support

### üìà Performance Metrics
- **Total Portfolio Value**: Combined value of holdings + cash
- **Total Cost Basis**: Amount invested (excluding gains/losses)
- **Overall Return**: Portfolio-wide performance percentage
- **Position-level Returns**: Individual holding performance

### üìù Transaction History
- **Complete Record**: All transactions affecting the account
- **Transaction Types**: BUY, SELL, DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, DIVIDEND, INTEREST, FEE, ADJUSTMENT
- **Detailed Information**: Quantities, prices, fees, and notes

## How It Works

### Position Calculation Algorithm

1. **Starting Point**: Account opening balance becomes initial cash
2. **Transaction Processing**: Each transaction affects positions or cash:
   - `BUY`: Reduces cash, increases position, adds to cost basis
   - `SELL`: Increases cash, reduces position, reduces cost basis proportionally
   - `DEPOSIT`: Increases cash balance
   - `WITHDRAW`: Decreases cash balance
   - `DIVIDEND/INTEREST`: Increases cash balance
   - `FEE`: Decreases cash balance

3. **Cost Basis Tracking**:
   - Weighted average cost including all fees
   - Proportional reduction on partial sales
   - FIFO-based for complex scenarios

4. **Market Valuation**:
   - Real-time price fetching for current holdings
   - Market value = quantity √ó current price
   - Unrealized P&L = market value - cost basis

### Example Calculation

**Traditional IRA Account:**
- Initial Cash: $50,000
- Buy 100 NVDA @ $400 + $10 fees = $40,010 total cost
- Buy 50 GME @ $80 + $5 fees = $4,005 total cost
- Dividend: $500

**Result:**
- Cash: $50,000 - $40,010 - $4,005 + $500 = $6,485
- NVDA: 100 shares, cost basis $40,010 ($400.10 avg)
- GME: 50 shares, cost basis $4,005 ($80.10 avg)
- Total Invested: $44,015

**With Current Prices:**
- NVDA @ $450: Market value $45,000, Unrealized gain $4,990 (+12.5%)
- GME @ $85: Market value $4,250, Unrealized gain $245 (+6.1%)
- **Total Portfolio**: $55,735 ($6,485 cash + $49,250 holdings)
